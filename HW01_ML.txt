A program that can do regularized linear model (polynomial basis) regression.

Input parameters: 
    1. the file path and name of a file of which each row represents a data point (common seperated: x,y): 
        1,12
        122,34
        -12,323
         ...
    2. the number of polynomial bases (n). phi0(x) = x0, phi1(x)=x1, phi2(x) = x2, ..., phin(x) = xn.
    3. lambda

Behavior:

For example, if the number of bases is set as 3, it means that the program is going to find a curve that best fits the data by ax2 + bx1 + cx0 = y.

Required functions:

    1. Use LU decomposition to find the inverse of (ATA - lambda*I); A is the design matrix.
    2. Print out the equation of the best fitting line and the error

NOTE:

Use whatever programming language you prefer.
You should use as few functions from any library as possible. 
Time complexity is not what we care for now, but if you like to improve it in that regard, it is always good for you.
